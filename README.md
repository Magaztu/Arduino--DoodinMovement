# Arduino--DoodinMovement
Little Arduino project I made a while ago, it's just a dood being silly!


This project uses a weight sensor and a DC motor to move / make dance a dummy.
It has two modes: coin weight and spin levels.


## In Spin levels, or manual mode:
  - You must use the keypad to control the speed.
      - Max. speed level is 7.
  - Press `*` to change the mode.

## In Coin weight, or automatic mode:
  - Put coins in the scales [Dollars or 10 Cents coins].
    - Max. speed level is reached at $2.
  - Press `*` to change the mode.

### Other parts:
This project also uses a (SCALE MODEL), (SCALE CONTROLLER), 4X4 KEYPAD, (MOTOR CONTROLLER), DC MOTOR, HANDCRAFT MATERIALS.
